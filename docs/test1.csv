56AB,8/16/17,concert,Steilacoom Pioneer Park,Print Media,0,8/22/17 19:17,"Concert billed as America's Band - where was the band? 4 man combo who sounded like they were sight-reading music they couldn't sight-read. Trombone and Sax not together, unstable intonation, uninspiring choice of music (seemed to be reading out of fake books). Hard to believe this is considered one of the best army bands."

100AB,12/28/15,Veteran's Day Concert,"Maupin Elementary School, Louisville KY",,0,1/27/16 19:33,"On September 11, 2015, i submitted a Musical and Ceremonial Request to SSG Benjamin Garnett with the 100th Army Band (Fort Knox) for a Veteran's Day performance. After several email conversations with SSG Garnett, he replied on October 20, 2015 and set a performance date and time for November 9, 2015 and 1:00pm. On November 5, 2015, I received an email from SSG Garnett informing me that his ""command wasn't able to secure necessary funding"" for our Veteran's Day program. Being notified of this cancellation only four days before the event was both unprofessional and inconsiderate. I teach in a school located in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, and for this reason, I tray to offer my students a variety of opportunities they may not experience outside the classroom. Having an Army Band perform for them would have given my students an opportunity to hear quality live music while also making a real-life connection with patriotic music. Because I wasn't notified of the cancellation until four days before our Veteran's Day program, I was not given enough time to make alternate plans. I had been preparing my students to hear an Army Band for at least a month, and the students were excited for this opportunity. I sent a flyer home with students inviting their veteran family members to join us for this program. Therefore, when I was notified of the cancellation, I panicked. I had made preparations for months, and the main event had cancelled. Working in a public school, I am very familiar with the constant struggle of lack of funding for government organizations. However, I believe this situation should have been handled with more respect and consideration to the schools. I fully support funding for programs such as this, and I plan on making another request for next year's Veterans Day program. I hope that in the future, the 450 students in my school are considered before a last minute cancellation because of lack of funding is issued. Sincerely, Dana Gumm Maupin Elementary School"

135AB,7/5/14,Fair St. Louis,"Forest Park, St. Louis, MO",Print Media,0,7/6/14 11:54,"We planned a Saturday, July 5th outing at Fair St. Louis around seeing the 135th Army Band. We had no other real interest in the events at Fair St. Louis. We left our house at 10:30am, arrived at the Fair entrance at 11am, waited in the hot sun until the gates opened at 12 noon, walked to the Parade Town stage, and set up our chairs. We knew something was wrong because we noticed some other band doing sound checks. We checked with the Sound Engineer and he said he didn't think the 135th Army Band was going to play but he wasn't sure. Ten minutes later, we checked with another event organizer and he said the 135th Army Band was not going to play because not enough band members showed up. My family and several other people we met were very dismayed at this news. I'm very surprised a U.S. Military organization could be so callous and dishonorable as to not show. There was no notice in the newspaper, no notice on TV, no notice on the Fair website, and no notice at the event itself. What happened? Even this website says nothing. We wasted several hours of our Saturday. Doug Cauble doug.cauble@urs.com"

My serial #24899593 was after three years was that of Cpl. Why were the records not complete back to 1953, and why is my serial number not included in the records? My musical records should show that I played the baritone or tenor saxophone in the band. The first year our summer camp was at Fort McClellan, AL. The next two were at Camp Shelby, MS. My Address is P.O. Box 143, Saltillo, MS 28866. My former address while in the band was 468 N. Church Street, Tupelo, MS 38801. The records here should have been transferred from Oxford to Jackson.

50AB,8/10/16,Merchants Square Summer Breeze,"Williamsburg, VA",Print Media,1,8/11/16 11:09,While the musicians were very talented this event was not as published in the newspaper. It was not the full TRADOC BAND. It was only three musicians playing funk music. Not band music. It also was very loud. Too loud actually. The venue last night was and is most nights composed of a lot of senior citizens and a high portion of veterans. Please be aware of your audience. I saw a good number of folks leaving after about 30 minutes. Ken
389AB,10/8/14,Courtesy performance,"MDA cafeteria, RSA",,1,10/9/14 10:00,"Band is fine. It is nice of you to offer to entertain. The reason I am writing is that to enjoy the music, it needs to be quieter. I'm sorry to criticize, but whenever the band plays, regardless of the ensemble's composition, it is so loud that we cannot talk to each other without raising our voices. Lunch is a time of relaxation--a break from the pressures of work--but it is not relaxing to find conversation difficult, regardless of how nice the music might be. Yesterday, someone pulled a decibel meter app out and the group was measured at an average of 95dB--and that was at the far end of the cafeteria, let's say over 100 feet away. At that distance, we measured a peak of 100dB. The 'safe' zone for noise is a continuous 85 or so with peak noise allowable above that in spikes. The music volume was continuous; the 95 average is not a measure of spikes. All of us would like to enjoy your music with lunch, but at these volumes, it just is not enjoyable. In fact, we were taken by surprise with yesterday's performance. We have been in the habit of getting your schedule and going off-campus for lunch whenever we see that you will be at Von Braun III. We would not do that if the music was closer to dinner club background volumes rather than the current rock concert levels. Hope you find this to be a constructive comment and will discuss it with your crew. Sincerely, R. Caniglia 256-450-2457"
389AB,12/15/13,Holiday Concert,Randolph School,"Social Media, Print Media, Email",1,12/16/13 9:32,"I wanted to submit an anonymous feedback since I work with some of you on occasion at HQ AMC, and I didn't want there to be any hard feelings caused by my feedback. I was one of the few people at last years' concert, so I have a frame of reference with which to compare this year's performance. Overall, I would say that last year's concert was much better and better put together. This year's concert was advertised much better and had a better attendance. I think that the complete lack of a ""theme"" this year was a major problem vs. last years' radio show theme. It seemed more like you were playing music ""at"" us rather than as part of a program, especially the whole unexpected encore thing (perhaps a more exciting last song would have prompted an encore). One more thing that a lot of people missed was the Four Star Jazz Band. Big Band music is always great at this time of year, and it was a disappointment to not hear it. Also, the rock band (though I found it impressive and entertaining) was not appropriate for most of the older crowd, and many of them actually got up and left during their portion. I think that in the future, you need to think about the audience you are playing for and adjust fire accordingly. Overall, I was let down from the last few years' programs, but everything seems fixable from an operational standpoint. As far as the music goes, since I'm not a musician myself, I have no idea what would improve it, so I won't comment on that. Thank you."
TUSAB,9/15/13,Concert,Brucker Hall,ABO,1,9/29/13 15:52,"The conductor (Lt. Huff) seemed lost most of the time, making dramatic gestures a moment after musical climaxes. Typically, talented conductors make gestures a split second before the music happens. Programming was oddly paced, making for an uneven listening experience. The video that accompanied movements from ""The Planets"" seemed to be nothing more than a haphazard assembly of clips of outer space. There was no discernible connection to the music. I have enjoyed this band's concerts for a long time, but there has been a noticeable decline in this band's frequency of and quality of performance since Col. Rotondi's retirement."
50AB,3/15/13,Heritage of Heroes 30 Mar 2013,"Ferguson Center, Newport News VA",,1,3/22/13 7:42,"The recent cancellation of the much anticipated Heritage for Heroes event advertised in the December 2012 Holiday Show reflects poorly on the Army. While symbolic, it's very difficult to see how this home town event avoided any cost & certainly did not save any funding (the band lives here). Conversely, it shows how band leadership makes decisions on other than a business basis. Harry Opel, 757-344-9213"

50AB,7/4/17,4th of July,Norfolk,Other Website,2,7/5/17 10:30,"Please accept my comments with my intent: to make it better next time. For the 2nd year in a row, the TRADOC Band's excellent performance was interrupted by a 15 min trio (from TRADOC) performing about four rock and roll songs that had nothing to do with the 4th of July. This is a 4th of July celebration of our country's birth and the ENTIRE performance should reflect that purpose. I do, however, commend the one-song New Orleans jazz number. Even though this single song wasn't ""patriotic"" per se, it was very good and entertaining. And the jazz number was limited to one song. The multi-song, single-singer, rock and roll was mediocre at best, and an unwelcome distraction from the event. Simply put, it was out of place. Thanks for your time. Steve Helveston, Lt Col, USAF (ret)"

102AB,7/29/16,"wEST hAVEN, ct",Oak strreet deck Savin Rock Festival,Email,2,7/29/16 22:05,"The bass guitar level was far too loud in my opinion. It's in a frequency sprctrum range that doesn't directly interfere with the vocals or hprn frequencies, . I suggest you record the group and play it back with playback system EQ'ed to be flat and listen If a bass is booming only the drummer can tell you where beat one is. Yes , I' old. I was in the 82 nd band in Stuttgardt, Germany when Rock around the clock came out--1955 )bill Haley and the Comets). But currently I* have been featured in National Veteran shows. To me the bass was EQ.ed wrong and was too loud. Sorry"
13AB,12/5/15,Honoring WWII Vets,Hollybrook Golf &Tennis Club,,2,12/11/15 6:05,"Overall the band was great, however, we were very disappointed that they did not play any of the military style music such as the service anthems. Additionally, we had requested a Color Guard to walk in our 18 WWII vets, and they were not available. This band appeared at our community on the past Memorial Day and were spectactular and we immediately set up this return engagement for December. Our expectations were enormous. The music and the beautiful young men and women were a pleasure to see and hear but we were a little disappointed in the duration of the concert and the choices of the music. We all thank you for your service and for all that you do for our safety.and are extremely proud of all that you do."

It would be amazing if they could play some more upbeat music meant to entertain their audience. Everyone in the audience was asleep except for during the one trombone/guitar song and the Armed Forces songs. This has been a recurring theme at Fort Gordon. The audience wants to hear a good selection of musical genres, especially fun songs and rocks songs for the younger crowd. I know this band has the capability to put on a great show.

At halftime of the ball game Friday the 19 as an ensemble from the 1 Cav. band was performing when your announcer come onto the field and started talking on the speaker system over the music and had team members on the field throwing Frisbees to the stands BEFORE the band had finish. This Army band came to provide entertainment at likely at NO Cost to your team only to be mistreated and disrespected in this manner is totally unacceptable.

While past performances here have demonstrated that ""tying"" the band's sound output into that of the Church is not feasible, it would be [and has proven to be] perfectly acceptable to have announcements/commentary projected through the Church sound system. Control of that facet could either be managed by the Band's sound person via the Church's wireless CRESTRON controller, or by Church personnel."

399AB,12/18/13,Holida Classics Concert,"Abrams Theater, Fort Leonard Wood, MO",Broadcast Media,3,12/19/13 22:29,"It was good to see a more traditional Christmas concert. A few years ago it was more like a fiasco or three ring circus. The commander at Fort Leonard Wood contributed to that in my opinion but that was another time. This performance was good but marred by the audio failure. How distracting and unfortunate for the performers and announcers. When Major General Smith was reading 'Twas The Night Before Christmas' and the mike went out, he handled it very well. The video player had issues, too, and when they were doing a tribute to Battle of the Bulge the sound went out and there were loud pops. At first I thought they were trying to use them as sound effects of the bombs going off. Then the screen went blue so I figured there must be a malfunction. In addition to the above, in my opinion, for what it's worth, playing the entire movie sound tract to ""Home Alone"" was boring and not entertaining to those who have never seen nor care about a movie that came out at Christmastime and not really be a ""Christmas"" movie. I would rather hear just traditional Christmas music not edited by someone who is trying to build a better mouse trap so to speak. That's just me. Maybe this event is moving more toward the younger generation. One more thing. This has nothing to do with the performance of the band. They are good. Real good. Too bad Abram's Theater didn't clean or stock their bathrooms before the concert. The lack of toilet paper in some stalls, empty paper towel holders and trash on the floor seemed disrespectful to the audience."

The band was wonderful but it was unfortunate that we could not hear the soloist. I don't know if his voice was not strong enough or the sound system not working for his hand mike. The second soloist, Nestor Semidei, had a wonderful voice."

38ID,7/7/13,Concert,"Kehoe Park Bluffton, In",Word of Mouth,3,7/8/13 12:07,"Band put on an entertaining show. Great Trumpet section, Vibraphone soloist is excellent. Sound man too closely miked the bass drum during concert band so it sounded like cannon shots. Middle brass Euphonium, Trombone and to an extent horns were a bit weak. Jazz band did a good show. Great rhythm section drummer was rock solid as was the Bass player. Jazz band MC was a bit unprofessional came off a being nervous and unprepared. Giggled too much not very unsoldierlike. Although trombones were weak the bass trombone really locked it in with the bari-sax and added a solid foundation too the group. All in all an enjoyable show. My feedback is only to make for a better show hope it's taken in that manner."

The patriotic music that finished up the performance was much needed to remind us all in this time of so much political division, that we are all still Americans and we have a lot to be proud of.

It is the first time they have presented here and it was a huge success!! I know a few of the members because I'm a music teacher and our paths cross at times. It was a high-energy performance with a lot of student engagement from just hand clapping to singing lyrics from songs along with the group. As a retired USAF regional band instrumentalist, I was impressed with the music skills *all* of the players presented to the school and my band students. My trumpet students were enthused by the lead trumpet's high range (aren't they all ;-) ) and one of my young trombonists was just as excited by the group's trombone player's soloing. So much so that he sought out the player to ask what was his secret to such a big sound. The man said it was a secret - - - practice. What an excellent, teachable moment. I don't recall his name, but as a fellow trombonist, I wanted to give him a high-5 for knowing the exact right thing to say for students. I plan to invite the band to come individually or as ensembles are available to play for my classes, give clinics, perform again for the school student body. It was an excellent performance, the Army message of music and academics are important was given clearly and it was a fantastic way to end a week of testing for 1/2 the student body. Kudos to all involved!"

As an educator, planner of this event and a music lover, I give the AMC Band an A+. I want to be able to invite them again in the future, to add musical entertainment to our event.

My daughter enjoyed the quintet's jazz rendition of ""Take me Out to the Ballgame."" I liked the Polka number best. My only negative feedback is the event was poorly publicized. I only saw one non-nondescript flyer taped in one unpopular restaurant's window.

What was most appreciated, is that it was clear he was holding us to a high standard in our musicianship and character. The way Alan carries himself was great to observe, and is what tempted me most to consider joining the Army (even on top of the solid informational meeting he presented). He was very clearly a man of excellence, honor, humility, and integrity. As great as a musician as he is, I'm more thankful to have had to experience to play alongside and learn from one of the finest gentlemen our country has to offer. Regardless of whether I join the Army or pursue another career path, it's men like Alan who I feel set the best example for how to serve and care for the people we interact with. Thank you for providing him with the opportunity to travel and spend time at UWEC, and for giving us the chance to learn from him. - David"

I’ve spent 24 years of my life serving our great nation in uniform, all around the world, where I’ve had the pleasure of hearing numerous Army bands. Of all the events that I’ve attended, the band that played at the PEO Missiles and Space Dining-Out was the best, bar none! All the selections they played were contemporary, upbeat, and entertaining. The music level for dinner was perfect, not too loud where it would drown conversation at a table, yet loud enough to create a highly pleasant back drop. Yet, beyond a doubt the SSG who sang (and I am remiss that I failed to jot down his name) was beyond ""Spot On"". This NCO has a set of pipes on him that brought the house down. The man has SERIOUS talent! The band made the night an incredibly memorable event and one I will cherish for years to come. Please give my thanks to the band. They were awesome!"

He was in complete control and extracted some of the finest musical nuances from the band including dynamic levels and balance. A thing of beauty. It was also very powerful as he personally thanked and honored each individual veteran from the podium by saluting, looking them in the eye and mouthing ""thank you for your service and sacrifice"".

Recommend trying stronger voice for the ""letters from home"" performance - perhaps experiment with male for the lyrics joined by female for refrain.... and fewer instruments to ensure the intended emotional response. You've performed it for the past several years and it is always difficult to hear the lyrics... maybe recite them vs sing?

If one has ever participated in a high school band, following the musicians and tuning in to the sound of the sections (woodwind/brass/percussion) makes it ideally more challenging. As you watch the conductor even with his back to the audience it brings back memories of the baton and hand motion what he says to the musicians. Many rehersals are necessary to prepare for a performance, and what accomplishments made in music for all to enjoy. In the future may you return again for our enjoyment.

I liked it when the director took over the tuba and tried to play it (Ryleigh). The dance-off was stupendous (Bella). You are the best band ever (Samantha). That was an amazing, totally entertaining performance. I know we'll be talking about it until we get to see you (we hope) again soon. Thank you so muchm Mrs. Soderquist"

Perhaps something like 3 cornets/trumpets, 3 trombones, 3 french horns, two euphoniums, & a tuba? A suggested genre for such would be a ""gasy"" pops flavor that get typical audiences' blood moving."

However, my feedback has to do with the very prominent body ink on the right forearm of soloist SGT Megan Van Oudenaren. I thought body ink in the military could not be visible, especially at a concert performance. This was very evident in the two civilian gowns she wore. To me, the visibility of this large tattoo distracted from her overall vocal performance."

Truly unique as a music form, jazz is all American and has evolved and grown as our nation has grown and represents the diversity of our cultures. The performance was impressive and moving.

From the many who missed the performance, several stated that they ‘heard the news” and wished they had changed their schedules so they could have attended. Further review of empty seats by Charlie and school personnel indicates that attendance was close to 600 people. We hope that you will be able to return for a visit in the next year or two, and in doing so, we most likely will “fill the joint!” Our welcome mat is out for you any time you would like to return to the Poconos. Please share our appreciation with the entire band and support personnel. We are very proud of you, and what the 28th has done for Pennsylvania and our entire nation! With our sincere gratitude, Rick Bodenschatz President"

It was the first time my children have ever seen an Army band play and I am thrilled it was Biohazard. During the parade, they fell-in with a community band that was ""wheezing"" during the parade, and represented the US Army, Ft. Sam Houston and all military musicians admirably. Their ""spotlight"" performance was professional: in-tune and entertaining! Kudos to the arranger for ""Get Lucky"" and ""Ghostbusters"" especially. They put on a very good show while maintaining their professional bearing. I wish when I was serving my unit had put together a band as hip as Biohazard! Well Done! Sincerely, Sean Ziegler"

Not particularly pleased with the jazz arrangement of the Christmas songs, though--I wanted to sing along! Joined the choir/instrumentalists on two songs without any practices--amazing job! Their brass really added a lot to the overall sound.

We could have set them up differently, had we known this beforehand."

As soon as I walked into the station, I heard ""live"" music, not the typical piped in holiday music. Wow, a live band, wonder who it is? To my amazement, I did not see crazy musicians in bizarre outfits. I didn't see a big name band. I saw something better... US soldiers entertaining crowds of weary travelers. The band was great, but I was mad that I couldn't stay. It's been several years since I've seen a live band. The music was GREAT and made even sweeter knowing that it was being played by US soldiers.

I think he was the only child there--he absolutely loved it and named some of the songs as you started playing them! You're repertoire was fantastic--spanned all generations and all types of music. I really wanted to dig out my old baton and march or get up and polka! The music and participants all worked together so well--very heartwarming! Not sure why there were so few present and especially no young folk, but what a loss to those that didn't come. It's disappointing for you all I'm sure, but just know that those there truly appreciated it! We appreciate all you do for service to our country, and yet you're all able to let your love of life shine through in your performance.

It was a great group! Thoroughly entertaining. The only thing negative I have to say about the group is that the piano playing the banjo part sounded pretty rough. I'm a big fan of dixieland music and regularly attend swing dances with the Funky Pirates, so I'm very familiar with this style and it would be better to either have the pianist play actual piano or not play at all. Thanks a bunch. Also, tell Jordan that Jason says hey and ill see him at the show on the 31st. Cheers!"

I saw another performance of that piece by your band earlier this summer where it wasn't used. I didn't know it at the time, but the piece just wasn't complete without it! As an amateur parade whistler, I have a deep appreciation for the complex technique and long hours of practice it takes to produce such a rich, clear sound. A lot of people don't have my level of respect for this. In fact, I have even come across people who were willing to hide my whistle from me out of jealousy of my skill. I sincerely hope that your whistler has never had to deal with this. Once again, thank you for playing at our park, and a special thank you to the parade whistler! You rock!"

This exceeded my expectations as my father had played saxophone in the Army National Guard Band in Muncie, IN before WWII and again after the war until he retired. To be able to hear this band continue the long time tradition is gratifying and should be continued. In addition, many at the performance would like to have this performance repeated in our community again but we were told how difficult it is to schedule. This band must be a remarkable morale builder for our army personnel serving our country. I hope it will always be part of the army's options to serve and share such wonderful musical talent.

Eustis and the music department at Christopher Newport University - hats off to all of the participants for reaching from town to gown (or from military hat to college tuxedoes!)."

(The WOODCHUCKS voices are so loud you cannot hear the instruments, thus WOODCHUCK evenings are so torturous that I quit promoting your events and inviting people.) Your instruments ARE your talent, the best musicians in MO, so I love your JAZZ and REGGAE and CALIPSO and CLASSICAL and love love love your MARCH MUSIC ! (You should play that JAZZ 399th group whenever possible and quit on those WOODCHUCKS - and I will once again ask people to your concerts.) That Arts evening was a delightful. So was your Christmas show in Rolla at Leach Theater. Thanks a bunch. Anne"

This is the second but certainly not the last time that we will have them come to our community!! Our residents who are in their 70s, 80's, and 90's always have a fantastic time. The band always goes above and beyond at our events. At this dance our Enrichment Coordinator Emily Newkirk is getting ready for a birthday! She loves men in uniform so the band played Happy Birthday while the crowd sang to her and each member of the band danced with her!! These men our an outstanding example of our military! After the dance was over they stayed around and while the DJ continued to play music for our staff they joined in!! We just love each and everyone of these men! Thanks again for bringing joy to our 115 senior, guests, and staff!!"

Once they were finished some of them stayed and danced with our residents (senior citizens) Much to their delight!!!!

Jackson & 108th Division Tng [USAR, Charlotte, NC, 1971-1977), and still a casual musician, I was most impressed with the demeanor, command, and presentation of all of the band's personnel.

With regard to the actual performance, the technique, intonation, dynamics, and presentation were comparable to if not better than, many professional symphonic bands I have heard.

## Getting Started
Make sure your Python version is 3.x or later.  
`pip install textblob vadersentiment pandas xlsxwriter` if your native Python is 3.x. Use `pip3` otherwise.  
I may have forgotten a few dependencies - if you are missing `nltk` or other related dependencies, `pip`/`pip3` will be able to install those for you.  
`python3 src/view.py` can get you started with usage. See output.xlsx for your results.
